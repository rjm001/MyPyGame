# PyGame

- Pygame extends Python to allow programmers to create windows, show images, recognize mouse movements and clicks, play sounds, more. I.e., it alallows you bto build games and interactive applications in Python.
- Upper left is 0,0. X incrteases to the right. Y increases going down. X and Y always integers
    - `pixelLocation = (3,5)`
- rectange is  (x,y, width, height)
    - `<rectObject> = pygame.Rect(<x>, <y>, <width>, <height>)`
```python
#RGB colors
RED = (255,0,0)
GREEN = (0, 255, 0)
BLUE = (0,0, 255)
BLACK = (0,0,0) #no red, green or blue
WHITE = (255,255,255) #all red, green, blue, 2^8 for each values
DARK_GRAY = (75, 75, 75)
MEDIUM_GRAY = (128, 128, 128)
LIGHT_GRAY = (175, 175, 175)
TEAL = (0, 128, 128) # no red, half-strength green, half-strength blue
YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)
PURPLE = (128, 0, 128)
```

## Event-Driven Programs

- GUIs call for them
- event: something that happens while your program is running that your program wants to or needs to respond to. Most generated by users actions.
- Event-driven GUI program runs constantly in an infinite loop!

- `blit()` from bit block transfer. effectively means draw.
- `<soundVariable> = pygame.mixer.Sound(<patah to sound file>)`
